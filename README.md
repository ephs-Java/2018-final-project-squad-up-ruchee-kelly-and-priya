# final-dix-sept-erledigt
2017 Final Team Project
Ruchee Sawant, Kelly Pu, and Priya Mehra

Our project is a game, sort of like Flappy Bird; here are some components

1.) We need to be able to change the X and Y locations of the "bird" 

2.) We need to set the X and Y locations of the pipes

3.) ^ Set the scale for these two

4.) Constantly be able to adjust the height and width of the objects in the game

5.) For loops, calling different methods


This game is exactly like flappy bird
The player will be using keys to move the bird around


Week 1 Goal: Design the interface of Flappy Bird.
